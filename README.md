## 🧩 Collaboration Guidelines

1. Each participant creates a separate branch in GitHub.
2. A new page is created for each participant in the `members/` folder.
3. After completing the page, a Pull Request is submitted to merge it into the main branch.

This workflow allows practicing collaborative work, version control, and organized integration of changes.
